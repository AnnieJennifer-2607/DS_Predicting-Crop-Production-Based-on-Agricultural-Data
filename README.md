# DS_Predicting-Crop-Production-Based-on-Agricultural-Data

# Overview
 This project predicts crop production (in tons) using agricultural data such as area harvested, yield, and year. It applies regression models and presents results through a Streamlit web application to support agricultural planning and decision-making.

# Problem Statement
Accurate crop production forecasting helps optimize supply chains, inform policy decisions, support precision farming, and improve market planning.

# Approach
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and standardized metrics
EDA: Explored trends across crops, regions, and years
Modeling: Trained and evaluated regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
Deployment: Streamlit app for real-time predictions
